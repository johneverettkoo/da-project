@article{Torralba2003b,
  abstract = { While navigating in an environment, a vision system has to be able
	to recognize where it is and what the main objects in the scene are.
	We present a context-based vision system for place and object recognition.
	The goal is to identify familiar locations (e.g., office 610, conference
	room 941, main street), to categorize new environments (office, corridor,
	street) and to use that information to provide contextual priors
	for object recognition (e.g., tables are more likely in an office
	than a street). We present a low-dimensional global image representation
	that provides relevant information for place recognition and categorization,
	and show how such contextual information introduces strong priors
	that simplify object recognition. We have trained the system to recognize
	over 60 locations (indoors and outdoors) and to suggest the presence
	and locations of more than 20 different object types. The algorithm
	has been integrated into a mobile system that provides realtime feedback
	to the user.},
